1). What runs JavaScript outside the browser ?    
    JavaScript can be executed outside of web browsers using different runtime environments such as Node.js, Electron, Deno, and Nashorn.

2). Name 5 things Javascript can do.
    a Building dynamic user interfaces: Javascript is often used to        create  responsive and interactive features on websites, such as dropdown menus, collapsible sections, and sliders.

    b Modifying web pages in real-time: Using Javascript, it is possible to change the structure and content of a web page on the fly, adding, removing or altering elements as needed.

    c Full-stack web development: With the help of technologies like Node.js, Javascript can be used for server-side scripting, enabling developers to build complete web applications.

    d Retrieving and processing data: Javascript enables developers to make asynchronous requests to servers, retrieve data and manipulate it to deliver dynamic user experiences.

    e Automating tasks and calculations: Javascript can be used to write scripts that automate routine processes or perform complex calculations, making it useful for applications such as form validation, data analysis, and image processing.

3). When was ECMAScript first released ?
    The first version of ECMAScript, also known as JavaScript, was introduced in June 1997 as part of the ECMA-262 standard.

4). How do you log to the console?
     You can log to the console using the console.log() method. 
     This function takes one or more arguments that you want to display in the console, and it outputs these values to the developer console available in most web browsers.
     console.log("Hello, World!");
     This will display the message "Hello, World!" in the console.

5). List the tech fields that use JavaScript, for example FrontEnd.

    a Back-end web development: With technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side scripting and back-end development.
    b Front-end web development: JavaScript is a popular choice for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces for websites and web applications.
    c Mobile app development: JavaScript is used in combination with other technologies such as React Native and Ionic to build cross-platform mobile applications.

    d Game development: JavaScript can be used to create simple games, such as browser-based games, and game engines such as Phaser use JavaScript as their programming language.

    e Virtual and augmented reality development: JavaScript is used to create interactive VR and AR experiences with tools like A-Frame and React VR.

    f Artificial intelligence and machine learning: JavaScript libraries like TensorFlow.js allow developers to build and train machine learning models directly in the browser.

    g Internet of Things (IoT): JavaScript can be used to build IoT applications, for example, with Node-RED, which allows for rapid prototyping and deployment of IoT systems.

6). Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

    Statically typed programming languages are those in which the data type of a variable must be specified at compile time, before the program is executed. In these languages, the type of a variable cannot be changed during runtime. Examples of statically typed programming languages include C, Java, and C#.

    On the other hand, dynamically typed programming languages are those in which the data type of a variable is determined at runtime. In these languages, the type of a variable can be changed during the execution of the program. e.g JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP,Perl.

7). Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;

    Null and undefined are used to represent absence of value.but they have a subtle difference.

    undefined is a value that is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared, but have not been assigned a value. It indicates that the variable has been declared, but does not yet have a value.

        example
        let x;
        console.log(x); // outputs: undefined

    null, on the other hand, is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that an object reference points to no object.

        let x = null;
        console.log(x); // outputs: null
        
 In other words, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, while null means a variable has been assigned the value null, explicitly indicating that it points to no object.
